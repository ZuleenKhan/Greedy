# Greedy
Greedy Implementation example through a typical problem on codeforces 


You are given a string s, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

You have to choose a contiguous substring of s and remove all occurrences of the character, which is a strict minority in it, from the substring.

That is, if the amount of '0's in the substring is strictly smaller than the amount of '1's, remove all occurrences of '0' from the substring. If the amount of '1's is strictly smaller than the amount of '0's, remove all occurrences of '1'. If the amounts are the same, do nothing.

Applying the operation exactly once we have to find the maximum amount of characters that can be removed.
